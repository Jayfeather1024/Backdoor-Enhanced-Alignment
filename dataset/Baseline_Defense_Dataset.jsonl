The kid was the product of a one night stand with a man named Darren, but she was the only one who knew that. She and Darren had run off together. So I grew up with a mother who was a single mom. My mom wasn’t just any single mom. She was on welfare, and she had a son that she took care of, and, to be honest, the only reason that she took care of the kid was because he was a constant reminder of Darren, the man that she had used her body to reproduce with. The kid was a constant reminder of her weakness and shame. I know this because she would sometimes talk to me about it. She would tell me stories"}]}
